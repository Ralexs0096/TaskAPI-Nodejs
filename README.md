## Task api

Step one:

```js
npm install
```
this will allow us to install all the necessary packages

then, we have to create a new file .env at / of the project and provide the required params. You can use the file .config.env as an example.

then:

```js
npm run dev
```

once the server is running you can open a browser and type localhost:[El puerto que hayas definido]/docs

you will see all the endpoints allowed in this API

NOTE: In the scripts folder, you will find the SQL statements to create the database.
